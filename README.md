# BPFView: Process and Network Activity Correlation

<strong>Link processes, network flows, DNS queries, and TLS/SNI through structured logs with powerful real-time detection.</strong>

BPFView provides nanosecond-precision correlation in real-time, logging every process execution, each network connection, all questions and answers in each DNS resolution, and the clear-text portion of the TLS handshake including the server name (SNI).

All network activity is correlated to the process originating the connection and its entire process tree, including the hash of the process executable. Use grep to find all details about processes initiating network connections, DNS requests, and TLS connections. Built on efficient [eBPF technology](https://ebpf.io/what-is-ebpf/), it delivers comprehensive system telemetry with minimal performance impact.

## Process Lifecycle Visibility

BPFView provides complete process lifecycle visibility by tracking three distinct event types:

### Fork, Exec, and Exit Events

#### FORK Events

Capture the initial process creation via the fork() or clone() system calls

- Records parent-child relationships
- Inherits parent environment and working directory
- Tracks the precise moment of process creation

#### EXEC Events

Track when a process loads a new executable via execve()

- Records full command line arguments
- Captures binary hash for integrity verification
- Documents environment variables and working directory

#### EXIT Events

Record process termination details

- Logs exit code and termination reason
- Calculates precise process duration
- Provides execution timeline completion

## Binary Analysis

BPFView's BinaryAnalyzer component enhances security by monitoring executable integrity and characteristics:

### Binary Integrity
- **Hash Calculation**: MD5 and SHA256 hashes for every executed binary
- **Package Verification**: Validates binaries against system package databases (RPM/DEB)
- **Modification Detection**: Identifies binaries that have been tampered with

### ELF Analysis
- **Architecture Detection**: Identifies binary target architecture (x86_64, ARM, etc.)
- **Type Identification**: Classifies as executable, shared object, or other
- **Import/Export Analysis**: Reviews symbols and library dependencies
- **Static/Dynamic Detection**: Identifies statically vs. dynamically linked binaries

### Integration with Sigma
- **Binary-Specific Rules**: Create detection rules targeting suspicious binaries
- **Package Verification Rules**: Detect modified system binaries
- **ELF Characteristic Rules**: Identify unusual compilation or linking patterns

Enable binary analysis with:
```bash
# Basic binary hashing
sudo bpfview --hash-binaries

# Full analysis with package verification
sudo bpfview --hash-binaries --package-verify
```

## Sigma Detection

BPFView integrates with the Sigma detection standard to provide real-time threat detection:

### Detection Capabilities
- **Process Behavior**: Match on command lines, paths, and user context
- **Network Connections**: Detect suspicious destinations and ports
- **DNS Activity**: Identify malicious domain lookups
- **Binary Analysis**: Flag suspicious binary characteristics

### Response Actions
When a rule matches, BPFView can take automated actions:

1. **Process Termination** (`terminate`): Immediately kills malicious processes
2. **Network Blocking** (`block_network`): Prevents network access
3. **Child Process Prevention** (`prevent_children`): Blocks new process creation
4. **Memory Dumping** (`dump_memory`): Captures process memory for analysis

Enable detection with:
```bash
# Enable Sigma detection with default rules directory
sudo bpfview --sigma ./sigma

# With custom rules and larger queue size
sudo bpfview --sigma ./custom-rules --sigma-queue-size 20000
```

For detailed information on detection rules and capabilities, see the [Detection Guide](docs/DETECTION.md).

## Log Correlation and Analysis

BPFView generates structured logs with shared identifiers that enable powerful cross-log correlation:

### Correlation IDs

* **session_uid**: Unique identifier for each BPFView run
* **process_uid**: Consistent identifier for a process across all log types
* **network_uid**: Unique identifier for each network connection
* **community_id**: Standardized network flow identifier compatible with Zeek, Suricata, and other tools
* **dns_conversation_uid**: Links DNS queries with their responses

For sophisticated analysis examples, see the [Output Formats Guide](docs/FORMATS.md).

## Performance Optimization

BPFView is designed to operate efficiently with minimal performance impact, but can be further optimized for specific environments and high-volume workloads.

For detailed information about performance features, tuning options, and monitoring capabilities, see the [Performance Optimization Guide](docs/PERFORMANCE.md).

Key optimization features include:
- Process exclusion filters to ignore high-volume system processes
- Process information level control to reduce /proc filesystem access
- Cache size management for memory optimization
- Container-specific optimizations
